The function takes a grid (2D list) and a number `k` as input.\n2. It initializes two empty lists: `visited` to keep track of visited cells, and `path` to store the cells on the path.\n3. `min_path` is a list of `k` infinity elements. `min_path_cell` is a list of `k` None elements.\n4. The function uses a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to traverse the grid.\n5. For each cell, it checks all its possible neighboring cells. If any neighboring cell is visited and is within the grid bounds, it will visit that cell and add it to the path.\n6. If the current cell is the final cell in the path, it checks if the path length is smaller than the current smallest path length.

The grid is represented as a 2D list where each cell represents the cost to move from that cell to the end.\n\nThe `minPath` function takes two parameters: a 2D list `grid` and an integer `k`.

It also initializes `min_val` as `float('inf')` which is a large number.\n\nThe function then enters a while loop that continues as long as there are unvisited cells in the grid. Within this loop, the function checks if there is a cell that can be reached from the current cell. If there is, it calculates the new path and checks if it's the shortest path found so far.
