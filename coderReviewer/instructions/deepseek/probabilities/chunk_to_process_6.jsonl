A prime number is a number that has only two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. That is, it is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\nHere is the function definition:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n```\n\nThis function takes a single parameter `n` and checks if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is less than 2, it returns `False` because a prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any such number, it returns `False`. If `n` is not divisible by any such number, it returns `True`.\n","log_probs_c_given_i":-17.765625}
