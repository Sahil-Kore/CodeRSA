The sorting operation is not applied to the list after replacing the numbers. The numbers are sorted before they are replaced, which is not the correct operation.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef sort_arr(arr):\n    arr = sorted([i for i in arr if 1 <= i <= 9])\n    return arr\n\ndef replace_arr(arr):\n    replace_dict = {1: \"One\", 2: \"Two\", 3: \"Three\", 4: \"Four\", 5: \"Five\", 6: \"Six\", 7: \"Seven\", 8: \"Eight\", 9: \"Nine\"}\n    return [replace_dict[i] for i in arr]\n\ndef reverse_arr(arr):\n    return arr[::-1]\n\ndef main(arr):\n    arr = sort_arr(arr)\n    arr = replace_arr(arr)\n    arr = reverse_arr(arr)\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code now correctly sorts the numbers, replaces them, and reverses the array.\n"}
