The musical notes are divided into three categories: 'o', 'o|' (a double bar) and '.|' (a single bar). The corresponding beats are represented by the integer values 4, 2 and 1 respectively.\n\nFor example, if we call `music_string = 'o o| .|'`, the function will return `[4, 2, 1]`.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n- The string is split into a list of notes using the `split()` method.\n- An empty list `beats` is created.\n- For each note in the notes list:\n  - If the note is 'o', the beat is 4.\n  - If the note is 'o|', the beat is 2.\n  - If the note is '.|', the beat is 1.\n  - The beat is appended to the `beats` list.\n- Finally, the `beats` list is returned.\n"}

If `n` is not divisible by any number from 1 to its square root, the function will return `n` itself.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).\n- For each `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n` modulo `i` equals to 0). If it is, it means `n` is divisible by `i`, so the function returns `i` as the smallest number.\n- If it doesn't find any `i` that makes `n` divisible, it returns `n` itself.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nprint(smallest_divisor(36))  # Output: 1\nprint(smallest_divisor(100))  # Output: 10\n```\n"}

If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is a prime factor. Then, `n` is divided by `i` and the function is repeated. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and the function is repeated. If `n` becomes 1, the function returns `n` as the largest prime factor. If `n` has no prime factor, the function returns -1.\n"}
