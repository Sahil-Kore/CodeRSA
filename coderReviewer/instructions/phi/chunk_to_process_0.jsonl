Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean (average) of all the numbers in the list. Use the `sum()` and `len()` functions to calculate the mean.\n```python\ndef mean(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers) \/ len(numbers)\n```\n\n4. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the median (middle value) of all the numbers in the list. Use the `sorted()` function to sort the list and the `len()` function to find the middle value.\n```python\ndef median(numbers):\n    numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    n = len(numbers)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return (numbers[n\/\/2-1] + numbers[n\/\/2]) \/ 2\n    else:\n        return numbers[n\/\/2]\n```\n\n5. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list of numbers with duplicates removed. Use a set to remove duplicates.\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers):\n    return list(set(numbers))\n```\n\n\n"}

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list of numbers sorted in descending order. Use the `sort()` method to sort the list.\n```python\ndef sort_descending(numbers):\n    numbers.sort(reverse=True)\n    return numbers\n```\n\n2. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list. Use the `sum()` method to calculate the sum.\n```python\ndef sum_list(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers)\n```\n\n3. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean (average) of all the numbers in the list. Use the `sum()` and `len()` functions to calculate the mean.\n```python\ndef mean(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers) \/ len(numbers)\n```\n\n4. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the median (middle value) of all the numbers in the list. Use the `sorted()` function to sort the list and the `len()` function to find the middle value.\n```python\ndef median(numbers):\n    numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    n = len(numbers)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return (numbers[n\/\/2-1] + numbers[n\/\/2]) \/ 2\n    else:\n        return numbers[n\/\/2]\n```\n\n5.

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list of numbers sorted in descending order. Use the `sort()` method to sort the list.\n```python\ndef sort_descending(numbers):\n    numbers.sort(reverse=True)\n    return numbers\n```\n\n2. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list. Use the `sum()` method to calculate the sum.\n```python\ndef sum_list(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers)\n```\n\n3. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean (average) of all the numbers in the list. Use the `sum()` and `len()` functions to calculate the mean.\n```python\ndef mean(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers) \/ len(numbers)\n```\n\n4. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the median (middle value) of all the numbers in the list. Use the `sorted()` function to sort the list and the `len()` function to find the middle value.\n```python\ndef median(numbers):\n    numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    n = len(numbers)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return (numbers[n\/\/2-1] + numbers[n\/\/2]) \/ 2\n    else:\n        return numbers[n\/\/2]\n```\n\n5. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list of numbers with duplicates removed. Use a set to remove duplicates.\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers):\n    return list(set(numbers))\n```\n\n\n"}
