Introduction to Exceptions\n2. Handling Exceptions\n3. Raising Exceptions\n4. Catching Exceptions\n5. Using Exceptions in Quantitative Analysis\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Exceptions\nExceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. Exceptions can be handled to prevent the program from crashing.\n\n#### 2. Handling Exceptions\nPython provides a way to handle exceptions using the try and except block. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 3. Raising Exceptions\nAn exception can be raised using the raise statement. The raise statement takes an exception object as an argument.\n\n```python\nraise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n```\n\n#### 4. Catching Exceptions\nExceptions can be caught using the try and except block. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 5."}

Introduction to Exceptions\n2. Handling Exceptions\n3. Raising Exceptions\n4. Catching Exceptions\n5. Using Exceptions in Quantitative Analysis\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Exceptions\nExceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. Exceptions can be handled to prevent the program from crashing.\n\n#### 2. Handling Exceptions\nPython provides a way to handle exceptions using the try and except block. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 3. Raising Exceptions\nAn exception can be raised using the raise statement. The raise statement takes an exception object as an argument.\n\n```python\nraise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n```\n\n#### 4. Catching Exceptions\nExceptions can be caught using the try and except block. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 5."}

Introduction to Exceptions\n2. Handling Exceptions\n3. Raising Exceptions\n4. Catching Exceptions\n5. Using Exceptions in Quantitative Analysis\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Exceptions\nExceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. Exceptions can be handled to prevent the program from crashing.\n\n#### 2. Handling Exceptions\nPython provides a way to handle exceptions using the try and except block. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 3. Raising Exceptions\nAn exception can be raised using the raise statement. The raise statement takes an exception object as an argument.\n\n```python\nraise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n```\n\n#### 4. Catching Exceptions\nExceptions can be caught using the try and except block. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 5."}

Introduction to Exceptions\n2. Handling Exceptions\n3. Raising Exceptions\n4. Catching Exceptions\n5. Using Exceptions in Quantitative Analysis\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Exceptions\nExceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. Exceptions can be handled to prevent the program from crashing.\n\n#### 2. Handling Exceptions\nPython provides a way to handle exceptions using the try and except block. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 3. Raising Exceptions\nAn exception can be raised using the raise statement. The raise statement takes an exception object as an argument.\n\n```python\nraise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n```\n\n#### 4. Catching Exceptions\nExceptions can be caught using the try and except block. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 5."}

Introduction to Exceptions\n2. Handling Exceptions\n3. Raising Exceptions\n4. Catching Exceptions\n5. Using Exceptions in Quantitative Analysis\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Exceptions\nExceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. Exceptions can be handled to prevent the program from crashing.\n\n#### 2. Handling Exceptions\nPython provides a way to handle exceptions using the try and except block. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 3. Raising Exceptions\nAn exception can be raised using the raise statement. The raise statement takes an exception object as an argument.\n\n```python\nraise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n```\n\n#### 4. Catching Exceptions\nExceptions can be caught using the try and except block. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 5."}

Introduction to Exceptions\n2. Handling Exceptions\n3. Raising Exceptions\n4. Catching Exceptions\n5. Using Exceptions in Quantitative Analysis\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Exceptions\nExceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. Exceptions can be handled to prevent the program from crashing.\n\n#### 2. Handling Exceptions\nPython provides a way to handle exceptions using the try and except block. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 3. Raising Exceptions\nAn exception can be raised using the raise statement. The raise statement takes an exception object as an argument.\n\n```python\nraise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n```\n\n#### 4. Catching Exceptions\nExceptions can be caught using the try and except block. The except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # code that may raise an exception\nexcept ExceptionType:\n    # code that will be executed if an exception is raised\n```\n\n#### 5."}

The element is added before the index specified, and all the elements to the right of the index are shifted to the right.\n\n#### Syntax of `insert` method\n\nThe syntax of `insert` method is as follows:\n\n```python\nlist.insert(index, element)\n```\n\nHere, `list` is the name of the list on which the `insert` method is being called. `index` is the index at which the element is being inserted, and `element` is the element being inserted.\n\n#### How to use `insert` method\n\nTo use the `insert` method, first, the index at which the element is to be inserted needs to be determined. This can be done using the `index` method of the list. Once the index is determined, the element can be inserted using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nindex = 2\nelement = 5\nmy_list.insert(index, element)\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `index` is set to 2, which means that the element 5 is being inserted at index 2. The final list is `[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.\n\n#### Real-world examples of using `insert` method\n\nThe `insert` method can be very useful in many real-world scenarios. For example, consider a scenario where a list of numbers is being sorted in ascending order. If a new number is added to the list, it needs to be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order. This can be done using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\ndef insert_sorted(num_list, new_num):\n    # Find the correct position to insert new_num\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(num_"}

The element is added before the index specified, and all the elements to the right of the index are shifted to the right.\n\n#### Syntax of `insert` method\n\nThe syntax of `insert` method is as follows:\n\n```python\nlist.insert(index, element)\n```\n\nHere, `list` is the name of the list on which the `insert` method is being called. `index` is the index at which the element is being inserted, and `element` is the element being inserted.\n\n#### How to use `insert` method\n\nTo use the `insert` method, first, the index at which the element is to be inserted needs to be determined. This can be done using the `index` method of the list. Once the index is determined, the element can be inserted using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nindex = 2\nelement = 5\nmy_list.insert(index, element)\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `index` is set to 2, which means that the element 5 is being inserted at index 2. The final list is `[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.\n\n#### Real-world examples of using `insert` method\n\nThe `insert` method can be very useful in many real-world scenarios. For example, consider a scenario where a list of numbers is being sorted in ascending order. If a new number is added to the list, it needs to be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order. This can be done using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\ndef insert_sorted(num_list, new_num):\n    # Find the correct position to insert new_num\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(num_"}

The element is added before the index specified, and all the elements to the right of the index are shifted to the right.\n\n#### Syntax of `insert` method\n\nThe syntax of `insert` method is as follows:\n\n```python\nlist.insert(index, element)\n```\n\nHere, `list` is the name of the list on which the `insert` method is being called. `index` is the index at which the element is being inserted, and `element` is the element being inserted.\n\n#### How to use `insert` method\n\nTo use the `insert` method, first, the index at which the element is to be inserted needs to be determined. This can be done using the `index` method of the list. Once the index is determined, the element can be inserted using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nindex = 2\nelement = 5\nmy_list.insert(index, element)\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `index` is set to 2, which means that the element 5 is being inserted at index 2. The final list is `[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.\n\n#### Real-world examples of using `insert` method\n\nThe `insert` method can be very useful in many real-world scenarios. For example, consider a scenario where a list of numbers is being sorted in ascending order. If a new number is added to the list, it needs to be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order. This can be done using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\ndef insert_sorted(num_list, new_num):\n    # Find the correct position to insert new_num\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(num_"}

The element is added before the index specified, and all the elements to the right of the index are shifted to the right.\n\n#### Syntax of `insert` method\n\nThe syntax of `insert` method is as follows:\n\n```python\nlist.insert(index, element)\n```\n\nHere, `list` is the name of the list on which the `insert` method is being called. `index` is the index at which the element is being inserted, and `element` is the element being inserted.\n\n#### How to use `insert` method\n\nTo use the `insert` method, first, the index at which the element is to be inserted needs to be determined. This can be done using the `index` method of the list. Once the index is determined, the element can be inserted using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nindex = 2\nelement = 5\nmy_list.insert(index, element)\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `index` is set to 2, which means that the element 5 is being inserted at index 2. The final list is `[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.\n\n#### Real-world examples of using `insert` method\n\nThe `insert` method can be very useful in many real-world scenarios. For example, consider a scenario where a list of numbers is being sorted in ascending order. If a new number is added to the list, it needs to be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order. This can be done using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\ndef insert_sorted(num_list, new_num):\n    # Find the correct position to insert new_num\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(num_"}

The element is added before the index specified, and all the elements to the right of the index are shifted to the right.\n\n#### Syntax of `insert` method\n\nThe syntax of `insert` method is as follows:\n\n```python\nlist.insert(index, element)\n```\n\nHere, `list` is the name of the list on which the `insert` method is being called. `index` is the index at which the element is being inserted, and `element` is the element being inserted.\n\n#### How to use `insert` method\n\nTo use the `insert` method, first, the index at which the element is to be inserted needs to be determined. This can be done using the `index` method of the list. Once the index is determined, the element can be inserted using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nindex = 2\nelement = 5\nmy_list.insert(index, element)\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `index` is set to 2, which means that the element 5 is being inserted at index 2. The final list is `[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.\n\n#### Real-world examples of using `insert` method\n\nThe `insert` method can be very useful in many real-world scenarios. For example, consider a scenario where a list of numbers is being sorted in ascending order. If a new number is added to the list, it needs to be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order. This can be done using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\ndef insert_sorted(num_list, new_num):\n    # Find the correct position to insert new_num\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(num_"}

The element is added before the index specified, and all the elements to the right of the index are shifted to the right.\n\n#### Syntax of `insert` method\n\nThe syntax of `insert` method is as follows:\n\n```python\nlist.insert(index, element)\n```\n\nHere, `list` is the name of the list on which the `insert` method is being called. `index` is the index at which the element is being inserted, and `element` is the element being inserted.\n\n#### How to use `insert` method\n\nTo use the `insert` method, first, the index at which the element is to be inserted needs to be determined. This can be done using the `index` method of the list. Once the index is determined, the element can be inserted using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nindex = 2\nelement = 5\nmy_list.insert(index, element)\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `index` is set to 2, which means that the element 5 is being inserted at index 2. The final list is `[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.\n\n#### Real-world examples of using `insert` method\n\nThe `insert` method can be very useful in many real-world scenarios. For example, consider a scenario where a list of numbers is being sorted in ascending order. If a new number is added to the list, it needs to be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order. This can be done using the `insert` method.\n\n```python\ndef insert_sorted(num_list, new_num):\n    # Find the correct position to insert new_num\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(num_"}

The docstring should explain how the function works, what it does, and what the input and output parameters are.\n\nThe prompt and docstring are shown below:\n\n```python\ndef is_dict_keys_string(dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if given dictionary has only string keys.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dict (dict): A dictionary\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the dictionary contains only string keys, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(dict) == 0:\n        return False\n    for key in dict.keys():\n        if not isinstance(key, str):\n            return False\n        if key.islower() and not all(key.islower() for key in dict.keys()):\n            return False\n        if key.isupper() and not all(key.isupper() for key in dict.keys()):\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n\n"}

The docstring should explain how the function works, what it does, and what the input and output parameters are.\n\nThe prompt and docstring are shown below:\n\n```python\ndef is_dict_keys_string(dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if given dictionary has only string keys.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    dict (dict): A dictionary\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the dictionary contains only string keys, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(dict) == 0:\n        return False\n    for key in dict.keys():\n        if not isinstance(key, str):\n            return False\n        if key.islower() and not all(key.islower() for key in dict.keys()):\n            return False\n        if key.isupper() and not all(key.isupper() for key in dict.keys()):\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n\n"}
