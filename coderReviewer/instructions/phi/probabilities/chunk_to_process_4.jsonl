In the above exercise, if the function is given a list of negative numbers, will the function return an empty list?\n\nSolution: No, the function will not return an empty list, since the code returns all elements greater than 0.\n\n2. What if the function is given an empty list?\n\nSolution: The function will return an empty list, since there are no elements greater than 0 in an empty list.\n\n3. What if the function is given a list with only one element, which is 0?\n\nSolution: The function will not return anything, since there are no elements greater than 0 in the list.\n\n4. What if the function is given a list with only one element, which is a negative number?\n\nSolution: The function will not return anything, since there are no elements greater than 0 in the list.\n\n5.

They help in understanding the code and its functionality, and are important for maintaining the code in the future. By practicing and implementing them in your code, you can improve your Python programming skills and build more robust and efficient programs.\n","log_probs_c_given_i":-1333.0}
