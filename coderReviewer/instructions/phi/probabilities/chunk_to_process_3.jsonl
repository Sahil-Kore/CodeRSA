It is often used to describe a task that needs to be performed, or a dataset that needs to be analyzed. A natural language instruction, on the other hand, is a command-style instruction that provides the user with specific details on how to perform a task. It is often used to give the user a step-by-step guide on how to perform a particular operation.\n\n\n","log_probs_c_given_i":-2464.0}

It is often used to describe a task that needs to be performed, or a dataset that needs to be analyzed. A natural language instruction, on the other hand, is a command-style instruction that provides the user with specific details on how to perform a task. It is often used to give the user a step-by-step guide on how to perform a particular operation.\n\n\n","log_probs_c_given_i":-2464.0}

Explain the difference between a natural language prompt and a natural language instruction.\n\nSolution:\nA natural language prompt is a command-style instruction that provides the user with an opportunity to interact with a text-based or graphical user interface. It is often used to describe a task that needs to be performed, or a dataset that needs to be analyzed. A natural language instruction, on the other hand, is a command-style instruction that provides the user with specific details on how to perform a task. It is often used to give the user a step-by-step guide on how to perform a particular operation.\n\n\n","log_probs_c_given_i":-2464.0}

Explain the difference between a natural language prompt and a natural language instruction.\n\nSolution:\nA natural language prompt is a command-style instruction that provides the user with an opportunity to interact with a text-based or graphical user interface. It is often used to describe a task that needs to be performed, or a dataset that needs to be analyzed. A natural language instruction, on the other hand, is a command-style instruction that provides the user with specific details on how to perform a task. It is often used to give the user a step-by-step guide on how to perform a particular operation.\n\n\n","log_probs_c_given_i":-2464.0}

It is often used to describe a task that needs to be performed, or a dataset that needs to be analyzed. A natural language instruction, on the other hand, is a command-style instruction that provides the user with specific details on how to perform a task. It is often used to give the user a step-by-step guide on how to perform a particular operation.\n\n\n","log_probs_c_given_i":-2464.0}
