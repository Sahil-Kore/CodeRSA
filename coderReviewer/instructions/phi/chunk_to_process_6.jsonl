In this section, we will explore the applications of loop lists and access items.\n\n### Loop Lists\n\nLooping through lists is a fundamental operation in programming. It allows us to iterate over the elements of a list and perform some action on each of them.\n\n#### Basic Loop\n\nA basic loop in Python uses the `for` keyword to iterate over the elements of a list. The loop runs for each element of the list, and the code inside the loop is executed once for each iteration.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\n#### Loop with Index\n\nSometimes, it is useful to know the index of the current element while looping through a list. We can achieve this by using the `enumerate` function.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor index, number in enumerate(numbers):\n    print(f\"Element at index {index} is {number}\")\n```\n\n#### List Comprehension\n\nList comprehension is a concise way of creating a new list by performing an operation on each element of an existing list. It is a more elegant and efficient way of looping through lists than using the `for` loop.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers"}

In this section, we will explore the applications of loop lists and access items.\n\n### Loop Lists\n\nLooping through lists is a fundamental operation in programming. It allows us to iterate over the elements of a list and perform some action on each of them.\n\n#### Basic Loop\n\nA basic loop in Python uses the `for` keyword to iterate over the elements of a list. The loop runs for each element of the list, and the code inside the loop is executed once for each iteration.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\n#### Loop with Index\n\nSometimes, it is useful to know the index of the current element while looping through a list. We can achieve this by using the `enumerate` function.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor index, number in enumerate(numbers):\n    print(f\"Element at index {index} is {number}\")\n```\n\n#### List Comprehension\n\nList comprehension is a concise way of creating a new list by performing an operation on each element of an existing list. It is a more elegant and efficient way of looping through lists than using the `for` loop.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers"}

In this section, we will explore the applications of loop lists and access items.\n\n### Loop Lists\n\nLooping through lists is a fundamental operation in programming. It allows us to iterate over the elements of a list and perform some action on each of them.\n\n#### Basic Loop\n\nA basic loop in Python uses the `for` keyword to iterate over the elements of a list. The loop runs for each element of the list, and the code inside the loop is executed once for each iteration.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\n#### Loop with Index\n\nSometimes, it is useful to know the index of the current element while looping through a list. We can achieve this by using the `enumerate` function.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor index, number in enumerate(numbers):\n    print(f\"Element at index {index} is {number}\")\n```\n\n#### List Comprehension\n\nList comprehension is a concise way of creating a new list by performing an operation on each element of an existing list. It is a more elegant and efficient way of looping through lists than using the `for` loop.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers"}

In this section, we will explore the applications of loop lists and access items.\n\n### Loop Lists\n\nLooping through lists is a fundamental operation in programming. It allows us to iterate over the elements of a list and perform some action on each of them.\n\n#### Basic Loop\n\nA basic loop in Python uses the `for` keyword to iterate over the elements of a list. The loop runs for each element of the list, and the code inside the loop is executed once for each iteration.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\n#### Loop with Index\n\nSometimes, it is useful to know the index of the current element while looping through a list. We can achieve this by using the `enumerate` function.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor index, number in enumerate(numbers):\n    print(f\"Element at index {index} is {number}\")\n```\n\n#### List Comprehension\n\nList comprehension is a concise way of creating a new list by performing an operation on each element of an existing list. It is a more elegant and efficient way of looping through lists than using the `for` loop.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers"}

In this section, we will explore the applications of loop lists and access items.\n\n### Loop Lists\n\nLooping through lists is a fundamental operation in programming. It allows us to iterate over the elements of a list and perform some action on each of them.\n\n#### Basic Loop\n\nA basic loop in Python uses the `for` keyword to iterate over the elements of a list. The loop runs for each element of the list, and the code inside the loop is executed once for each iteration.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\n#### Loop with Index\n\nSometimes, it is useful to know the index of the current element while looping through a list. We can achieve this by using the `enumerate` function.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor index, number in enumerate(numbers):\n    print(f\"Element at index {index} is {number}\")\n```\n\n#### List Comprehension\n\nList comprehension is a concise way of creating a new list by performing an operation on each element of an existing list. It is a more elegant and efficient way of looping through lists than using the `for` loop.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers"}

In this section, we will explore the applications of loop lists and access items.\n\n### Loop Lists\n\nLooping through lists is a fundamental operation in programming. It allows us to iterate over the elements of a list and perform some action on each of them.\n\n#### Basic Loop\n\nA basic loop in Python uses the `for` keyword to iterate over the elements of a list. The loop runs for each element of the list, and the code inside the loop is executed once for each iteration.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\n#### Loop with Index\n\nSometimes, it is useful to know the index of the current element while looping through a list. We can achieve this by using the `enumerate` function.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor index, number in enumerate(numbers):\n    print(f\"Element at index {index} is {number}\")\n```\n\n#### List Comprehension\n\nList comprehension is a concise way of creating a new list by performing an operation on each element of an existing list. It is a more elegant and efficient way of looping through lists than using the `for` loop.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers"}

Write a function that takes in a list of strings and returns a new list of strings with the first letter of each string capitalized.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndef capitalize_strings(strings: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    return [s.capitalize() for s in strings]\n\nprint(capitalize_strings([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])) # Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']\n```\n\n3. Write a function that takes in a list of strings and a target string, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list. If the target string is not in the list, return -1.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndef find_index(strings: List[str], target: str) -> int:\n    for i in range(len(strings)):\n        if strings[i] == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\nprint(find_index([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"], \"banana\")) # Output: 1\nprint(find_index([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"], \"orange\")) # Output: -1\n```\n\n4. Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list with only the even numbers from the original list.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndef get_even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n\nprint(get_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])) # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n5. Write a function that takes in a list of strings and returns a new list with only the strings that contain"}

If this condition is true, you will need to return True, since there are elements in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold. Otherwise, you will need to return False.\n\nYou will also need to add a check to see if the current element is equal to 1, in which case you will need to return False, since there can be no elements in the list that are closer to each other than the threshold if all the elements are 1.\n\nOnce you have completed the code, you will need to test it using the provided test cases.\n\nInstruct: You are an expert programmer.
