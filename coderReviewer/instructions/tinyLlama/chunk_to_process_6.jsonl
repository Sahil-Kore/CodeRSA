The `for` loop inside the `isprime` function iterates from 1 (which is a prime) to `int(a**0.5) + 1`. The `i` variable is incremented by 1 each time, and the `mod` operator returns `True` if the remainder is 0 (which means the number is divisible by 3).

The `for` loop inside the `isprime` function iterates from 1 (which is a prime) to `int(a**0.5) + 1`. The `i` variable is incremented by 1 each time, and the `mod` operator returns `True` if the remainder is 0 (which means the number is divisible by 3).
