The `words` list is initialized as an empty list and the `for` loop iterates from the first string to the last string, processing each string as it goes. Each string is converted to a list of characters using `string.split()`. The `if` statements check if each string is either empty or contains only punctuation characters, and if it does, the corresponding element is added to the `words` list.
